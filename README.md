This repository implements the basic bare metal code that if needed to boot up and work with the [SparkFun RED-V RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15594) development board which has a [SiFive RISC-V FE310 SoC](https://www.sifive.com/chip-designer#fe310) on it. The repo is intended to be used by those who are wanting to learn `assembly` language or `embedded C` and are looking for a development environment that allows them to tinker and explore starting at the very bottom of the things.

# How it works
## The Repo
```shell
.
├── License
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── scripts
│   ├── bm_test.gdb
│   ├── debug.gdb
│   └── layout.ld
└── src
    ├── main.c
    └── start.S
```
## Details 
`main.c` and `start.S` are the source files where you can append code. The processor starts of the execution from `_start` (in `start.S`), loads the stack pointer register `sp` with address pointing to the end of the RAM and then jumps to `main()` (from `main.c`). `layout.ld` is a linker script that details out which section of the code goes where in the memory.

To assist with the compiling, uploading the code and debugging using gdb, we have the following:
- Makefile : Automates compiling, uploading and, starting and attaching to debug server.
- scripts/ : This directory houses `gdb` scripts (along with the linker script `layout.ld`) that are used to test the setup and to attach to the `gdb` server.

# Setup
You would need to download the Freedom Studio SDK and set `FS_SDK_PATH` variable within the Makefile. You can get it from here: [Freedom Studio — v2020.11.0](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-studio/releases/tag/v2020.11.1)

## Testing setup
If you want to ensure that everything work as expected then you can build the default source without any changes and upload to the board. You can run the following in sequence:

Build the source and upload to board
```shell
make upload
```

Start a debug session
```shell
make debug
```

Wait until you see
```shell
...
Info : Listening on port 3333 for gdb connections
Info : Found flash device 'issi is25lp032' (ID 0x0016609d)
Ready for Remote Connections
Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```

In a separate terminal (in the root location of this repo) start the `gdb` session
```
make test
```
Following output should get printed 
```
❯ make test

A debugging session is active.

        Inferior 1 [Remote target] will be detached.

Quit anyway? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]

```
The `$1 = 42` print confirms that everything is working as expected!

# Flashing/Uploading to Board
Use the following command to build and upload the code to the board
```shell
make upload
```

# Debugging
To debug using GDB you can execute the following in one terminal
```shell
make debug
```
you should see the following
```shell
❯ make debug

Connect to the debug server by launching GDB from another terminal by executing the following commands
```shell
make gdb
```
This will connect with the debug server and drop the `gdb` prompt. you should see something as below:
```shell
❯ make gdb
